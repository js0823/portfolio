# portfolio
Personal portfolio website source code

## Introduction
I started this project for two reasons. One, I wanted to create my own portfolio page. Two, I wanted to learn about frontend development using Django, Bootstrap, and Nodejs. This Django portfolio template should give you a starting point on creating your own portfolio page quickly.

I would like to thank the Youtuber's video which I watched to help me create this webpage. The link is below.
